      "Phrase": "Time is like a roll of toilet paper. You know, the closer you get to the end, the faster it seems to go. And you're there, thinking, 'I swear I just replaced this roll yesterday.' Life's the same. One minute, you're 20 with a brand new roll, and the next, you're 50, trying to savor every sheet. Makes you wish you had a bigger roll or maybe just used it more wisely.",

      "Phrase": "Change is like getting into a hot bath. At first, you're like, 'Whoa, this is too much, let me out!' But then you adjust, and suddenly, it feels just right.
